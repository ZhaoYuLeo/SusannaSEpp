### Test Yourself

1. Given sets A and B, a relation from A to B is **a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$.**

2. A function F from A to B is a relation from A to B that satisﬁes the following two properties:
a. for every element x of A, there is **an element y of B such that $(x, y) \in F$.** 
b. for all elements x in A and y and z in B, if $(x,y) \in F$ and $(x,z) \in F$ then $y = z$.

3. If F is a function from A to B and x is an element of A, then F(x) is **the unique element of B that is related to x by F**.

### Exercise Set 1.3

1. Let $A = \{ 2, 3, 4 \}$ and $B = \{ 6, 8, 10 \}$ and define a relation R from A to B as follows: For all $(x, y) \in A \times B$, 

   $ (x, y) \in R$ means that $\frac{y}{x}$ is an integer.

   a. 4 $R$ 8 and $(2,10) \in R$

   b. $R = \{ (2,6), (2,8), (2,10), (3,6), (4,8)\}$

   c. Domain = $\{2,3,4\}$; Codomain = $\{6,8,10\}$

2. Let $C = D = \{ −3, −2, −1, 1, 2, 3 \} $ and deﬁne a relation S from C to D as follows: For all $(x, y) \in C \times D$, 

   $(x,y)\in S$ means that $\{\frac{1}{x}- \frac{1}{y}\}$ is an integer.

   a. 2 $S$ 2, -1 $S$ 1, $(3,3)\in S$, $(3,-3) \notin S$

   b. $\{(-3,-3),(-2,-2),(-2,2),(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(1,1),(2,-2),(2,2),(3,3)\}$

   c. $Domain = Codomain = \{ −3, −2, −1, 1, 2, 3 \}$

3. Let $E = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $F = \{ −2, −1, 0 \}$ and deﬁne a relation T from E to F as follows: For all $(x, y) \in E \times F$.

   $(x,y)\in T$ means that $\frac{x-y}{3}$ is an integer.

   a. 3 $T$ 0, $(1, -1) \notin T$, $(2,-1) \in T$, $(3,-2) \notin T$

   b. $T = \{(1,-2),(2,-1),(3,0)\}$

   c. Domain = E, Codomain = F

5. Define a relation S from R to R as follows:

   For all $(x, y) \in R \times R$, $(x, y) \in S\ means\ that\ x ≥ y$.

   a. $(2,1) \in S, (2,2) \in S$, 2 $S$ 3 is false, $ (-1)S(-2)$ is true.

   b. The straight line $y = x$ and all values below the line.
