### Test Yourself

1. A universal statement asserts that a certain property is **true** for **all elements of a set**.

2. A conditional statement asserts that if one thing is **true** then some other thing **also has to be true**.

3. Given a property that may or may not be true, an existential statement asserts that **there is at least one thing** for which the property is true.
